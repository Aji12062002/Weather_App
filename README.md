The completed weather data API project can be described as a Java Spring Boot application that provides real-time and historical weather data through RESTful endpoints, suitable for integration with frontends or other services. For documenting such projects, tools like Swagger or Smart-doc are recommended; Smart-doc is especially popular for Java and Spring Boot because it generates API documentation directly from source code comments, supporting multiple output formats such as Markdown, HTML, OpenAPI, and Postman collections
This application allows users to query current, hourly, and daily weather information for any location using latitude and longitude or city names. It supports data features including:

Weather conditions (with icons and descriptions)

Temperature (minimum, maximum, feels-like)

Wind speed and direction

For a Java/Spring Boot weather API, Smart-doc is a highly recommended tool for documentation. It generates comprehensive REST API docs from your project's code comments without requiring extra annotations or code changes. The documentation can be exported in formats suitable for Postman workflow, Markdown for reports, OpenAPI 3.0 for Swagger UI, or HTML for web viewing.

"A robust Java Spring Boot REST API offering real-time and historical weather data for any location. It provides reliable endpoints for temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, and other key meteorological metrics, designed for seamless integration into web applications and data analysis workflows."



Air pressure, UV index, visibility, and more.

The API returns responses in structured formats (usually JSON) and incorporates robust error handling for invalid locations and parameters.
